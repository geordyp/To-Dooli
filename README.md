# To Dooli
A to do list web application. The application is deadline driven so every task needs a deadline and it prioritizes tasks based on their due date. Works with the RESTful web service created in [Experimental-Server](http://www.github.com/geordyp/Experimental-Server).

## Technologies Used
* Knockout JS

## Setup
After downloading the project onto your machine there are at least two options for running the web application.

1. Simply open the 'index.html' file in your browser. The application will startup.
2. OR... navigate to the project folder in a terminal and start a server from the directory containing 'index.html'. For example, run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 then navigate to 'localhost:8080' in your browser and the web application will startup.
